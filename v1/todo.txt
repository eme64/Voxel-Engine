-------------- TODO -----------------

lighting - render with a queue? remember who already in?

------------- IDEAS -----------------

queue chunks to be light-rendered VS set flags, redo all with flag
if at border update (light, block, ...) -> also signal neighbouring chunk

------------ COMPLETED --------------
collision
fix up chunk rendering
smooth lighting
